# Overview

Hey, everyone. Welcome to my github repository. I created this kotlin note application, which allowed user to input any letter or digit they want and display on the top of the application. It also provided a check box and delete button for users to remove the notes.

# Development Environment

I am using the android stuido to create this Kotlin Note Application.
I have used a couple open source library like following

plugins {

    id 'kotlin-android'
    
    id 'kotlin-android-extensions'
    
}

Those two libraries allow me to import the element from xml file to the kotlin file.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Connect to the data base so the note can still be accessed after turning off the app.
* Allow users to input image as note.
* Adding Sorting function that allow user sort through the note by date they are created.
